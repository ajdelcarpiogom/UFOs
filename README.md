# UFOs

### Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a HTML page that will allow us to retrieve from a javascript data file using different filters on the page in order to find different sightings that occurred in the U.S. based on the different areas, date, or what type of shape of the UFO sighting.

### Results

As we click on the link to this website we find the title and the introduction of UFO sightings. Below, there are filters we can go through in order to filter from different categories such as date, city, state, country, and shape. Once we input our desired filter, the HTML page will show all the sightings from the search. We can use only one or more than one filter.

This is the result of me putting in "va" for the state.

### Summary
One drawback of this webpage is the limitation of information from the js data file. More information that could be added to this search could be the surveys of the people at each sighting and see how each survey matches in order for us to validate the accuracy of each sighting. Other filters such as whether there are photos or videos for people to see what others saw could also be more interesting to make this site better.
